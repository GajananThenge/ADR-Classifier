# ADR-Classifier
Monalisa, who is a Life sciences researcher does Pharmacovigilance (post-market drug safety
surveillance) for Pharma Products.

Pharmacovigilance identifies ADRs (adverse drug reactions) after a drug’s release. Comprehensive
knowledge of ADRs can reduce the detrimental impact on patient’s health system. Practically,
clinical trials cannot investigate all settings in which a drug will be used, making it impossible to fully
characterize the drug’s adverse effect profile before its approval. Pharmacovigilance methods
continuously analyse frequently updated data sources, Twitter in particularly because of its large
user base, demographic variability, and publicly available data.
ADR detection in social media requires automated methods to process the high data volume. It
would greatly help her if she is able to automate the segmentation of Tweet into either ADR or NONADR, on the basis of Drug, Symptom and Effect mentioned in future.

Your Job is to Classify the Tweet into the 2 segments, please describe your approach and share the
Python Code for the same.
